## About Rosalind
Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.

**Rosalind** is a platform for **learning bioinformatics through problem solving**.

Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in _biological_ and _computational complexity_; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.

Rosalind also promises to facilitate improvements in standard bioinformatics education by providing a vital teaching aid and a central homework resource.

Rosalind is inspired by _Project Euler_, _Google Code Jam_, and the ever growing movement of _free online courses_. The project's name commemorates **Rosalind Franklin**, whose X-ray crystallography with Raymond Gosling facilitated the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick.

Mission statement: We hope that Rosalind will inspire a new generation of bioinformatics students by attracting biologists who want to develop vital programming skills at their own pace in a unique environment as well as programmers who have never been exposed to some of the stimulating computational problems generated by molecular biology.
